. From the main Virtualbox screen, choose the *Kubic-Master* VM and
click on the down arrow next to the start icon. Click on Detachable
Start
. Log into the command line:
+
*_Userid:_* *root* +

. Use the kbd:[F10] key to go the next screen
. Use the kbd:[alt,s] keys to go to the Hostname/DNS screen
. Change the Hostname to *kubic-master*
. Use the kbd:[F10] key to finish:

.Task 2: Configure the Kubic-Worker1 VM
. From the main Virtualbox screen, choose the *Kubic-Worker1* VM and
